    <h1>About Us</h1>

        <h2>Welcome to Like Ahmad Ventures</h2>
        <p>Like Ahmad Ventures aims to share early childhood education knowledge from an Islamic perspective and emphasizes important aspects of educational knowledge. At the same time, it presents a more relaxed and fun-learning approach. Seeing that today's children are increasingly distant from faith, Islam, and morals, this initiative seeks to provide an opportunity for children to view Islam as more beautiful than they might have imagined.</p>
        
        <h2>Our Mission</h2>
        <p>Preserving education based on Islam to develop the potential of individual children through approaches that are more appropriate to their age, fulfilling the demands of the Islamic faith.</p>
        
        <h2>What We Offer</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Fardhu Ain - Lessons on basic Islamic knowledge</li>
            <li>School Holiday Program - Religious practices and project-based learning</li>
            <li>Short Course - Introduce children to Islamic values and education through engaging, age-appropriate, and fun-learning activities</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Our Values</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Providing explanations about Islam so they worship without coercion</li>
            <li>Serving children with the love and care they deserve</li>
            <li>Guiding children with wisdom in accordance with the example set by Prophet Muhammad</li>
        </ul>
